# Balances

A **Balance** represents the amount of funds available in a checking or savings account over a period of time.


‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note:

- The Balances endpoint is not supported for gig-economy links.
- If your Balance request is not for a checking or savings account, we return an empty array.
- If we cannot calculate the balance for a given day within your requested period, the `balance` and `current_balance` fields will return `null` for that day.
