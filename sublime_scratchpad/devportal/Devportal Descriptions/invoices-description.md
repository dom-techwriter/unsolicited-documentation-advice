# Invoices

An Invoice is the representation of an electronic invoice, that can be received or sent, by a business or an individual and has been uploaded to the fiscal institution's website. Multiple INFLOW (invoice received) and
OUTFLOW (invoice sent) invoices can be retrieved inside each link coming from a fiscal institution.
